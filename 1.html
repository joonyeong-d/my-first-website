<h2>Who is Buddha</h2>

<img src="buddha.jpg" width="100%">

<p><strong>Siddhartha Gautama</strong>, most commonly referred to as the <u>Buddha ("the awakened")</u>, was a wandering ascetic and religious teacher who lived in South Asia during the 6th or 5th century BC and founded Buddhism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 40px;"><a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/buddhism/" target="_blank" title="what is buddhism">Buddhism</a> (/ˈbʊdɪzəm/ BUUD-ih-zəm, US also /ˈbuːd-/ BOOD-),also known as Buddha Dharma, and Dharmavinaya (transl. "doctrines and disciplines"), is an Indian religion or philosophical tradition based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. It originated in the eastern Gangetic plain as a śramaṇa–movement in the 5th century BCE, and gradually spread throughout much of Asia via the Silk Road. It is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 520 million followers (Buddhists) who comprise seven percent of the global population.</p>
